Description: instrumentation system for Linux
 SystemTap provides infrastructure to simplify the gathering of
 information about the running Linux system.
 This assists diagnosis of a performance or functional problem.
 SystemTap eliminates the need for the developer to go through the
 tedious and disruptive instrument, recompile, install, and reboot
 sequence that may be otherwise required to collect data.
 .
 SystemTap provides a simple command line interface and scripting
 language for writing instrumentation for a live running system.
