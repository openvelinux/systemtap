How to set up Byteman support in Systemtap
==========================================

Systemtap now contains support for probing Java methods using the
Byteman tool from JBoss as a backend. In order to make use of it, two
things are required.

(1) Environment variable BYTEMAN_HOME must point to a valid Byteman installation.

Byteman can be obtained at http://www.jboss.org/byteman; alternately,
it can be installed through your distribution's package manager.
Either way, double-check that this enviroment variable is configured
correctly.

(2) libHelperSDT.so and HelperSDT.jar must be accessible to the local
JDK that you are planning to probe.
